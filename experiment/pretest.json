      "question": "What is the main goal of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To build machine learning models",
        "b": "To clean and preprocess data",
        "c": "To understand the underlying patterns in the data",
        "d": "To perform statistical analysis"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "While machine learning is important, EDA is more about exploring and understanding the data first.",
        "b": "Cleaning and preprocessing are part of data preparation, but EDA focuses on exploration.",
        "c": "Correct! The main goal of EDA is to understand the patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.",
        "d": "Statistical analysis can be part of EDA, but the primary focus is data exploration."

      "question": "Which of the following is a common method for visualizing data in EDA?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bar plot",
        "b": "Heatmap",
        "c": "Box plot",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Bar plots are commonly used in EDA for categorical data.",
        "b": "Heatmaps are used to visualize correlation matrices and patterns in EDA.",
        "c": "Box plots are often used to identify outliers and the distribution of data.",
        "d": "Correct! All of these are common methods used in EDA."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following would you most likely check during the EDA process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Data types of the features",
        "b": "Model accuracy",
        "c": "Hyperparameter tuning",
        "d": "Train-test split"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! In EDA, you would check the data types of features to understand the structure of the data.",
        "b": "Model accuracy is typically checked after building a model, not during EDA.",
        "c": "Hyperparameter tuning is part of model optimization, not EDA.",
        "d": "The train-test split happens after EDA when you are preparing data for model building."
