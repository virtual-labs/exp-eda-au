        "a": "Histograms show the frequency distribution but are not specifically used for identifying outliers.",
        "b": "Correct! Box plots are particularly useful for identifying outliers and visualizing data distribution.",
        "c": "Pie charts are used for showing proportions and are not useful for detecting outliers.",

      "question": "Which of the following techniques would you use in EDA to check for missing values in your dataset?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Box plots are useful for visualizing data distribution and outliers, not for missing values.",
        "b": "Correct! Null value analysis is performed to check for missing data in the dataset.",
        "c": "Bar plots are used for categorical data visualization, not for identifying missing values.",
